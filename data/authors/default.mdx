## The Project

Sentiment Scope is a new methodological exploration into using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to detect and quantify disgust sentiment expressed towards immigrant communities online. The objective of this project is to develop a robust, efficient, and cheap method for measuring intergroup disgust intensity, which will in turn provide insight into grassroots intergroup conflicts.

## Significance

Quantifying intergroup disgust via NLP offers a more objective and unbiased approach compared to traditional qualitative methods. Additionally, this methodology reduces costs and significantly increases the scale at which data can be analysed. The findings from this project have the potential to equip NGOs, government bodies, and other stakeholders with better tools to predict and manage intergroup conflicts effectively.

## Future Directions

While the initial focus is on anti-immigrant sentiments, the methodology will be extended to other intergroup tensions, such as interethnic, interclass, and interreligious conflicts. The ultimate aim is to create a cost-effective conflict-mapping tool that enhances current methods, improving our capacity to foresee and address grassroots conflicts.

Welcome to Sentiment Scope!
