## The Project

Sentiment Scope’s mission is to develop a new method of monitoring online discussions in order to measure one group’s disgust for another group, to provide valuable insight into both the causes of and potential for social conflict. We will develop a cost effective on-demand monitoring and evaluation tool that can be reliably adapted to any language, culture, and political context without the risk of bias. With this tool, we aim to equip NGOs, governmental agencies, and financial institutions with better tools to predict, mitigate, and manage intergroup conflicts effectively.


## Significance

Current methods of online content monitoring, such as measuring instances of hate-speech, easily fall prey to the cultural and political biases of the researcher, institution, or business applying such methods. By developing a cross-cultural model of moral disgust and an AI training methodology designed independently of political context or motive, we will be able to avoid such biases and therefore provide concrete, rigorous, and objective analysis of any community with a significant online presence. 

## Future Directions

While the initial focus is on anti-immigrant sentiments in Europe, the methodology will be extended to other intergroup tensions, such as interethnic, interclass, and interreligious conflicts. The ultimate aim is to create a cost-effective conflict-mapping tool that enhances current methods, improving our capacity to foresee and address grassroots conflicts. Furthermore, once the methodology regarding disgust is validated, it will be expanded to include a broader range of topics, such as hate speech, cyberbullying, and online harassment. Finally, the tool will be integrated with existing methods, allowing for a seamless and efficient monitoring and evaluation process.
