      "raw": "\n## Outline:\n\nIn this article, I propose a categorical schema to capture overt moral disgust narratives in online comment sections. This schema builds upon the works of respected researchers in moral psychology and sentiment, with a particular focus on the Moral Foundations Theory by Jonathan Haidt and the research conducted by Paul Rozin on the emotion of disgust.\n\nBefore introducing the schema, I'd like to briefly touch upon the background literature that influenced its development. Haidt's Moral Foundations Theory comprises six fundamental principles, three of which resonate with our schema: Purity, Authority, and Sanctity. These concepts share similarities with our Hygiene, Degeneration, and Religion components.\n\nRozin's research divides the emotion of disgust into three major types: Core Disgust, Animal-Nature Revulsion, and Interpersonal Disgust. Corresponding elements appear in our schema as Hygiene, Animal-Reminder, and Moral Violations.\n\nThe model incorporates and expands upon the foundational theories and research proposed by Jonathan Haidt and Paul Rozin. It integrates relevant aspects of their scholarship to create an collocation classification framework. It is important to note that collocations do not gain extra weight based on their association with multiple categories, as conceptual overlap is not a central concern. Taking this into account, my model incorporates insights from a variety of influential publications, further widening its scope and coverage of moral disgust narratives.\n\n## The Model:\nNow, I present the schema, which is divided into several categories. Each listing contains a brief definition, literature reference, and examples of lexis.\n\n  1.  Hygiene: Curtis, V., & Biran, A. (2001) provide insights into the role of hygiene in shaping human behaviour, suggesting that hygiene-related disgust serves an evolutionary function, helping humans avoid pathogens. The concept of hygiene often intersects with cultural norms, where non-adherence can result in a sense of disgust. In the context of immigrants, differences in hygiene practices or perceived cleanliness can lead to intergroup conflicts. In particular, comments suggesting that immigrants bring unclean habits can reinforce disgust sentiment.\n\n  Examples of potential lexis: dirty, filthy, mess.\n\n  2. Food: Fischler (1988) has explored the deep sociocultural implications of food, emphasizing how it plays a role in defining one's identity. Food-related disgust can stem from unfamiliarity or cultural differences. When immigrants introduce new or unfamiliar culinary practices, it can trigger negative sentiments in host populations, often driven by lack of understanding or fear of the unknown. These reactions are not just about the food itself but represent deeper fears about cultural contamination. \n  \n  Examples of potential lexis: References to the cuisine of the immigrant population, references to taboo food, references to gluttony.\n\n  3. Sex: Tybur et al. (2009) showed the connection between disgust and sexual behaviours. Disgust reactions can arise from perceived threats to reproductive success- whether these threats are explicitly behavioural or due to the spread of disease. Immigrant groups with different sexual norms- whether real or imagined- might be viewed with disgust by in-groups.\n\n  Examples of potential lexis: perverts, leering, rape.\n\n  4. Body envelope: Douglas (1966) details how violations of the body's boundaries can evoke sensations of impurity. Douglas postulates that violations or transgressions of these boundaries can evoke sensations of impurity and danger. Haidt, Rozin, McCauley & Imada (1997) explore the relationship between the body envelope and purity in greater detail, suggesting that there is a strong connection between body envelope violations and disgust. In the context of intergroup dynamics, unfamiliar or non-normative body modifications or rituals presented by out-groups can intensify in-group disgust sentiments.\n\n  Examples of potential lexis: female genital mutilation, tattooed, cripples (referring to disfigurement or missing limbs).\n\n  5. Religion: Haidt, Rozin, McCauley, & Imada (1997) delve into the intricate relationship between moral foundations, including sanctity and purity, and the emotion of disgust. Distinct religious practices introduced by immigrants might serve as triggers for prejudice, especially when these practices starkly contrast with those of the majority. Such differences often fuel the fires of in-group versus out-group dynamics, heightening perceptions of the out-group as not just different, but morally repugnant. This can manifest in language that underscores these differences and elicits disgust. \n  \n  Examples of potential lexis: Sharia law, mosques, godless, fanatics.\n\n  6. Animal-reminder: Rozin, Haidt, & McCauley (2008) postulated the theory of animal-reminder disgust, emphasizing human aversion to reminders of our biological nature. Outgroups can be perceived in a way which reduces their humanity by occluding their individuality, rationality, or culture, thus triggering an animal-reminder and amplifying feelings of otherness and disgust.\n\n  Examples of potential lexis: primitive, animalistic, masses, swarm.\n\n  7. Animals: Douglas (1966) has discussed the symbolic use of animals to create boundaries between in-groups and out-groups. Directly likening immigrants to animals serves to dehumanise and degrade. This is distinct from the animal-reminder in that it is not a reminder of the target’s biology, but a metaphorical assertion that the target is similar to a specific animal. \n\n  Examples of potential lexis: rats, pigs, cockroaches, locusts, breeding like rabbits.\n\n  8. Death: Ariès (1981) examines how death and decay are universal triggers for aversion. Haidt, Rozin, McCauley & Imada (1997) explore this aversion further, and argue that death and decay are strong triggers for disgust sentiment. Unfamiliar death rituals or practices introduced by immigrants can evoke disgust, as can stories of their death, if their dead bodies are referenced. \n\n  Examples of potential lexis: corpses, starving, references to dead bodies on the streets.\n\n  9. Disease: Schaller & Duncan (2007) delve into the evolutionary roots of disease avoidance behavior, suggesting that out-group members, like immigrants, can be erroneously perceived as carriers of disease, which fuels negative sentiments. Faulkner, Schaller, Park, & Duncan (2004) suggest that evidence of this relationship is manifest in xenophobic reactions during disease outbreaks. In addition, Kam & Estes (2016) argue that out-groups, including immigrants, have historically been framed using disease terminology, such as 'infestations' or 'plagues'. \n\n  Examples of potential lexis: infestation, infecting us, spreading like a plague.\n\n  10. Moral Violations (moral character?): Haidt (2001) provides a framework for understanding how moral foundations can lead to feelings of disgust, especially when societal norms are perceived to be violated. The different cultural backgrounds that immigrants have might inadvertently provoke such sentiments. \n\n  Examples of potential lexis: untrustworthy, playing the system, benefit fraud.\n\n  11. Out-group status: Tajfel's (1982) Social Identity Theory illustrates inherent human biases towards in-group favouritism.

      "raw": "## Disgust, Morality, and Intergroup Relations\n\nThis post includes a brief overview of the current literature on how disgust relates to the Behavioural Immune system, dehumanisation, and intergroup relations. It concludes with an argument for examining if the measurement of social narratives motivated by disgust can predict intergroup conflict. \nDisgust and Disease:\n\nDisgust plays a pivotal role in shaping individual behaviours, societal attitudes, and both cultural and moral norms. This is particularly relevant in in-group/out-group relations.\n\nDisgust sentiment is central to disease avoidance. Oaten, Stevenson, and Case (2009) delve into this emotion's role as a guardian against potential contaminants, guiding us away from stimuli indicative of disease risk. This encompasses a broad range of triggers, from direct biological stimuli such as rotting food to human behaviours that risk the spread of disease. When faced with such stimuli, the emotion of disgust emerges, prompting behaviours that mitigate the risk of contamination.\n\n## The BIS and ingroup/outgroup relations:\n\nThe Behavioural Immune System (BIS) offers a compelling model through which we can understand the intricate interplay between disgust and intergroup relations. At its core, the BIS details the pre-emptive behavioural and psychological strategies humans have developed to stave off diseases without our bodies having to mount a biological immune response.\n\nSchaller (2011) explores the broader social implications of this system. He suggests that, as disease can spread rapidly, and as pathogens are often undetectable through direct sensory means, the BIS has extended its sensitivity towards social and behavioural cues that suggest a risk, rather than presence, of infection. One such cue is perceived foreignness.\n\nHe writes:\n\n“There are at least two distinct reasons why subjective ‘foreign-ness’ may implicitly connote an increased infection risk. First, exotic peoples may be host to exotic pathogens that can be especially virulent when introduced to a local population. Second, exotic peoples may be more likely to violate local behavioural norms (in domains pertaining to hygiene, food preparation, etc.) that serve as barriers to pathogen transmission. Thus, perceivers are likely to be hypersensitive to inferential cues that discriminate between familiar and foreign peoples and, when those cues are detected, they are likely to trigger the aversive, discriminatory responses associated with the behavioural immune system. This is especially likely to occur when perceivers feel especially vulnerable to infection.\"\n\nThe BIS further manifests itself at the societal level. As Schaller (2011) explains:\n\n\"Intriguingly, there is also cross-cultural evidence linking xenophobia and intergroup prejudice to worldwide ecological variation in the prevalence of pathogenic diseases. Ecological variation in pathogen prevalence is correlated with the percentage of people in a population who explicitly express intolerance for ‘people of a different race’ in their neighbourhood, and with regional frequency of ethnopolitical warfare. Additionally, collectivistic value systems—which emphasize sharp boundaries between ‘us’ and ‘them’—are especially likely to exist in social ecologies characterized historically by especially high levels of pathogen prevalence. Thus, just as with sociality in general, discriminatory sociality is predicted by infection risk not only at an individual level of analysis, but also at a population level of analysis.”\n\nIn short, the BIS causes a disgust driven aversion to outgroups when the identity or behaviour of such outgroups are associated with the risk of disease- especially when the risk of disease is prevalent. His research shows that this effect is significant enough to be measurable at both the individual level and the sociological level. One such outgroup identity is ‘perceived foreignness’. Readers of this blog will also note the relationship between the prevalence of infectious disease and ethnopolitical warfare. The implications this has for the relationship between immigrant and native communities are clear.\n\n## Disgust, Dehumanisation, and Violence:\n\nFeelings of disgust for the other can go beyond passive aversion and avoidance. Sherman and Haidt (2011) posit that disgust towards a person possesses the capacity to dehumanise them in the mind of the disgusted party. They argue that, when confronted with stimuli that evoke strong disgust, individuals tend to perceive the source of that stimuli as less than fully human. This is not limited to perception- it is a process that can potentially strip the target of moral consideration, making mistreatment or harm towards them more palatable or even justifiable.\n\nThe processes by which groups or individuals are perceived as less than human are explored in depth by Holtz and Wagner (2011). They posit that outgroups can be denied uniquely human emotions through infrahumanisation, or be compared to animals or forces of nature through naturalisation. In both cases, the dehumanised group is excluded from the full set of moral considerations typically extended to 'true humans' by the ingroup.\n\n## Dehumanisation and the inhibition of violence:\n\nDehumanisation can reach genocidal extremes in the context of ingroup outgroup relations. Kelman (2014) delves into the dynamics behind violence that occurs without moral restraint. He suggests that the act of dehumanisation erodes the moral constraints typically in place against cruelty. When a group is no longer seen as human, the conventional moral rules governing interactions become inapplicable.\n\nFletcher (2014) provides an analysis of the prelude to the 1994 Tutsi Genocide in Rwanda, highlighting the role of the Mugesera speech. This speech used dehumanising rhetoric, positioning the Tutsis as threats and sub-humans, effectively setting the stage for the subsequent mass violence. In addition, historical evidence of dehumanisation is evident in the propaganda disseminated during World War II, particularly against Jews. An article titled \"How to Tell a Jew\" from the Nazi propaganda archives serves as an example, illustrating how rhetoric was used to depict Jews as the 'other', reinforcing stereotypes and furthering their dehumanisation.\n\n## Why Disgust Narratives?:\n\nThe literature reviewed thus far indicates that the BIS is a social defense mechanism which acts against the spread of disease. The BIS acts even when the risk of infection is not visibly present or noticeable, through encouraging the categorisation of some behaviours as inherently risky, and some groups of people as inherently prone to behaviours which risk disease. This can, under the right circumstances, make us averse to contact with persons perceived as belonging to a foreign outgroup. This aversion can manifest at the sociological level, such that periods of widespread illness correlate with both xenophobia and interethnic conflict. If such tensions and conflict are a result of the BIS spurring avoidant, aversive, and aggressive intergroup behaviours, then a measurement of the BIS at scale may be predictive of conflict.\n\nThe BIS is not a directly observable phenomenon, so any measurement must be of a highly related event, such as its triggers, mechanisms, or concurrent effects.\n\nRegarding triggers-\n\nWhile disease is measurable, the BIS also acts when the risk of infection is abstract. Such abstractions are learned and therefore socially informed. Worse still, they are often implicit. Any successful measurement of them would need to be deeply rooted in social and cultural context, and would therefore fail as a cost-effective and cross-cultural method.\n\nRegarding mechanisms-\n\nDisgust sentiment is highly associated with the BIS. It is therefore likely to be highly associated with the exclusionary behaviour the BIS can stoke- especially given that disgust is a key sentiment in moral judgement, as posited by Haidt (2001). This is further evidenced by the association between disgust driven intergroup narratives, the dehumanisation of a given outgroup, and the subsequent disinhibition of atrocities. If extreme disgust-driven dehumanisation by an in-group towards an out-group correlates with extreme forms of intergroup conflict, then it is reasonable to explore whether moderate disgust sentiment can predict moderate forms of intergroup conflict.\n\nHowever, disgust sentiment would also be difficult to quickly directly measure at the sociological scale. Many traditional methods, such as questionnaires and facial cues, would not be cost effective at scale. Others, such as examining economic or sociological patterns of behaviour, cannot be methodologically removed from the context of the society under study, and would thus similarly fail at producing a cost-effective tool.\n\nRegarding concurrent effects-\n\nSentiments spread through communication. Such communication is often verbal. Much grassroots verbal communication now occurs on the internet. As the following post will demonstrate, Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can quickly and reliably measure a social sentiment towards an outgroup in a large dataset containing intragroup grassroots communication. This is done through a quantitative analysis of word collocations, which suggest the intensity and frequency of narratives motivated by a given sentiment, in turn suggesting the intensity of said sentiment within an ingroup.\n\nIf frequency and intensity of disgust driven intergroup narratives within intragroup grassroots communication can be reliably measured, they can be used as a signpost for rises and falls in social disgust sentiment- a key proximal mechanism of the BIS. As will be explored in later posts, such narratives may in addition be a cause of disgust sentiment and thus BIS inflammation through a perception of social consensus.

Filthy rats. We need to clean up our country.\n\n        - Immigrants aren’t the problem, it’s ignorant people like you that are. They are not filthy, and they are not rats- they’re people just like you and me\n            - Whatever, snowflake\n\n\nExamples of bigrams which would pass manual selection:\n\n    - “filthy, rats”\n\n    - “they, rats”\n\n\nExamples of trigrams which would pass manual selection:\n\n    - “clean, rats, country”\n\n    - “they, are, rats”\n\n    - “country, clean, up”\n\n\nIn the example above, the bigram \"they, rats\" and the trigram “they, are, rats” are found in the comment: “They are not filthy, and they are not rats”. It constitutes a false positive, as it will be counted towards the total disgust score while in fact indicating an opposition to being disgusted with the outgroup.\n\nIf, in a given community, it is up for general debate whether an outgroup is composed of rats, then we may assume that many members of the community already hold disgust for the outgroup, as a significant number must be pushing the ‘rathood narrative’ for the debate to exist. This method is therefore sufficient to distinguish between a dataset which includes ‘disgust debate’ and one with no or very few references of disgust.\n\nConsider, however, a community not engaged in ‘disgust debate’, due to a broad agreement that an outgroup is categorically disgusting. How can such a highly and uniformly disgust-gripped community be distinguished from one in which many find the target outgroup disgusting, but a significant number do not?\n\nIf dissenters will argue against disgust driven narratives by negating the contained propositions directly, they would generate collocations which would pass manual selection and generate false positives. Worse still, such ‘disgust debate’ may spark more disgust references by the disgusted, who will be motivated to reinforce their narrative against the dissenters. It cannot be assumed that these excess disgust references constitute a rise in disgust sentiment within either the commenter or the broader community. They, too, may constitute a difficult to measure false positive effect.\n\nIt is possible therefore for a community that is engaged in disgust debate to generate a similar or even greater number of collocations which pass manual selection than a community in which there is no disgust debate due to a higher level of shared disgust.\n\nFor clarity, consider following two exchanges between pairs of hypothetical commenters:\n\nA:\n\n    - Immigrants are rats.\n\n        - No, immigrants are not rats!\n            - Yes, immigrants are rats!\n\n\nB:\n\n    - Immigrants are rats.\n        - Yes, they are. \n\n\nThe methodology laid out above would count the bigram, “immigrants, rats” thrice in exchange A and only once in exchange B, even though exchange B clearly displays agreement between two commenters that the outgroup are worthy of disgust, and should therefore be weighted more heavily by an appropriate methodology.\n\nThe most concerning aspect of this is the difficulty of measuring the effect of the debate using quantitative methods that are universally applicable to different lingual and cultural groups. For example, some groups may be more prone to fierce debate, and therefore generate more false-positive collocations. Other cultures may argue less analytically, and therefore make less direct references to the disgust narrative when debating, dampening the effect.\n\nPerhaps it is possible to account for this on a group by group or comment section by comment section basis, but this would be labour intensive and introduce qualitative bias, thus making it unsuitable for the task of providing a cost effective and reliable way to measure disgust sentiment at scale.\nHigher order collocations:\n\nOne option for overcoming this problem would be to use higher order collocations, such as quadgrams and quintgrams, to increase contextuality and allow for the capturing of more subtle expressions and turns of phrase with long dependency chains. This would potentially capture instances of disagreement, as well as other unforeseen instances of false positives.\n\nHowever, due to the increase in dimensionality, higher order ngrams impose exponentially higher demands on computing resources the longer an collocation becomes. This logistical difficulty would shrink the potential sample space dramatically, rendering statistical tests less powerful and compromising confidence in conclusions drawn from the more limited datasets. More concerningly, the employment of higher order collocations would considerably complicate the manual selection phase outlined above. This added complexity opens doors for the biases of either the researcher conducting the study or the end users involved to penetrate the data collection process.\n\nIn short, the collocation extraction method is by itself unable to sufficiently distinguish between agreement and disagreement with a sentiment without utilising higher order collocations, which would in turn significantly increase dimensionality and thereby significantly raise costs and the risk of bias to the method.\n\nSo, it is not feasible to use collocation extraction alone distinguish between an ingroup that is moderately populated with individuals that spread disgust narratives targeted at a given outgroup and an ingroup that is heavily populated by such individuals, due to ‘disgust debate’ generating a difficult to predict level of false positives in the data. This is a crucial obstacle to overcome, as if moral disgust narratives online are predictive of intergroup conflict, it may follow that widely accepted disgust narratives have a higher correlation with conflict than hotly contested disgust narratives.\n\nIt will be overcome by using the data generated through collocation extraction, TF-IDF analysis, and manual selection to train and refine an LLM to parse the data.\nLLM method\n\nAn efficient alternative to recognise and discount false positives can be made by training and refining a custom LLM to parse the data. I will first train the LLM on the broader corpus containing the targeted datasets in the study, using Haidt's categorical model and the collocations extracted from the datasets. The model will learn to recognise and differentiate between genuine expressions of disgust and false positives. I will then refine the model's disgust lexicon through iterative error correction. This process will involve continuously updating and refining the lexicon based on the model's predictions and feedback from the data it processes. Over time, this iterative approach will help the model to reduce false positives by learning from its mistakes and improving its accuracy in identifying true expressions of disgust.\n\nBy training the model to recognise and handle negatives in sentiment analysis, it will be better equipped to understand the context and nuances of 'disgust debate.' This adaptation will enable the model to distinguish between shared sentiments and debates within communities, thereby reducing the likelihood of false positives and providing a reliable way to differentiate between moderate and extreme levels of disgust sentiment within a community for a target outgroup.\n\nA second significant advantage of incorporating an LLM is its ability to process large datasets efficiently. Once a sufficiently low level of error is reliably achieved, it can analyse extensive data spanning decades to identify patterns and trends. This comprehensive analysis will help to contextualise the identified collocations and further reduce the impact of false positives by providing a broader perspective on online disgust sentiments within and across communities.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, I aim to minimise the false positive problem effectively, ensuring that the model's predictions and insights into online disgust sentiments are both accurate and reliable.\n\nIn the next post, I will discuss LLM specifications.",

The goal of this research is to develop an efficient and reliable method for quantifying intergroup disgust intensity online. Unlike an in-depth qualitative analysis, a quantitative analysis of disgust will be in less danger of falling prey to ideological and political biases, and, just as importantly, be less likely to be dismissed as biased towards a political agenda. This methods research will be the foundation for further study into whether such online disgust narratives are predictive of grassroots intergroup conflict.\n\nThe focus of the study will be disgust narratives levied online by local ingroups towards outgroups of immigrants and the descendents of immigrants. This is due to the pressing importance of native/immigrant tension in our times, its international and widespread prevalence during the European migrant crisis and Russia/Ukraine war, and the resultant ease of data collection regarding intragroup narratives and intergroup conflict in the case of local and immigrant groups. If further study demonstrates a predictive relationship between this initial project's measurement of disgust and conflict between locals and immigrant groups, then work will be expanded to measuring grassroots disgust narratives to predict other areas of intergroup conflict, such as in the case of interethnic, interclass, or interreligious tensions.\n\nIf all three projects prove successful, it will result in a cost-effective tool which, when used in tandem with existing methods, will help NGOs, government bodies, and other stakeholders to better predict and manage grassroots conflict.\n\n## Post schedule\n\nThe following posts of this blog will outline my methodology, which will proceed after this introduction as follows:\n\n  1.

      "raw": "\n\n## Quantifying Disgust\n\nFraming the task:\n\nThe final aim of this research is to develop a universally applicable disgust measurement tool to help predict conflict. With this in mind, it is prudent to begin the first project, an exploration into online disgust sentiment measurement, with a methodology designed independently of the language and culture in which the disgust narratives are propagated. This will minimise the labour required to tailor the tool to a specific ingroup later on. It will also reduce the possibility of cultural and perceptual biases- a highly relevant concern when studying both language and moral disgust towards outgroups.\nUsing nltk to quantify disgust narratives:\n\nUsing the Python program 'Natural Language Toolkit' (nltk), I plan to extract collocations- sequences of words which often collocate- from targeted datasets. Only bigrams (two collocating words) and trigrams (three collocating words) will be selected in order to reduce dimensionality.\n\nFor a full explanation of collocation extraction using nltk, see: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/collocation-language-modelling-with-nltk/\n\nThese datasets will be comment sections on forums and news articles with topics specifically pertaining to immigration or migrant groups, selected such that commenters are representative of a given community, ethnic ingroup, or socioeconomic class. Five such comment sections will be selected per month. Selection bias will be accounted for by selecting the first five articles or forum posts which occur in the month.\n\nI will find which collocations are likely to be targeted specifically at immigrant groups by identifying those collocations which do not frequently occur in comparable datasets which are not related to immigration or migrant groups.
